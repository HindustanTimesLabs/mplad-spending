Included in this package:

1. R code to generate analyses and figures in the piece  - analysis_HT_20180221.R
2. The dataset - MPLADS_ADR_PRS_15thLS.csv

Please note that the file path needs to be changed in the code to match with the location of the dataset on your computer.

The columns of the dataset coding moveable/immoveable wealth and major criminal cases are provided from candidate affidavits by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). I thank Milan Vaishnav for providing me with a web-scraped version of the ADR data. The data on MPLADS for the 15th Lok Sabha (the 8 columns of the dataset) are provided by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. All other data are provided by PRS Legislative Research.

The variable titles should be self-explanatory.
